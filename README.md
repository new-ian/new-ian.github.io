This is just me sharing some data science skills development work

I've been learning python (slowly :) ) since November 22
This is my first project I've had to share via github chiefly because the jupyter notebook got too big to attach to the community forum I was learning on.

I'm really enjoying learning and look forward to growing in skill and github feels like a fresh advance on the learning curve.

What's the project about?

It's a project to help me learn how to work with decision trees and ensemble methods (random forests) in python to examine a series of features relating to garment industry production.

Features list copied below:

The target of interest is - can we predict features that will allow us achieve prodcutivity target. In a business setting this might help business choose operational features appropriately to improve likelihood of meeting production targets.

The project title is: Project_22_Employee_Productivity_Tree_Models

In the project I examined 6 different models - 3 decision / classfication trees and 3 random forest classifiers. A key learning is that the simple 3 level decision tree model I instatiated in the first instance was almost as accurate as the more complex models and perhaps a great deal more easy to relate to non-techincal operational folk in the business.

Goign forward, if a business were to use some of the more detailed insights from the more complex models, there may be recourse to develop an application. The application could gather the feature inputs and return a classification around whether they're expected to achieve target with given inputs.
